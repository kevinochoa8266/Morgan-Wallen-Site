                Wallen was born in Sneedville, Tennessee, on May 13, 1993, and he grew up in the Knoxville area. His 
                father was a preacher who loved the bombast of hard rock, while his mother was a teacher whose tastes
                ran to contemporary Christian sounds. Wallen developed a strong interest in music at a very young age;
                he started singing in church when he was three years old and took up the violin when he was five. He 
                later learned to play piano and guitar, but in high school his passion was baseball, pitching for the 
                team at Gibbs High School in Corryton, Tennessee. He was good enough to earn offers to play college
                ball on a scholarship, but late in his senior year, an elbow injury put an end to his days as a
                pitcher, and he began considering music as a career.

                In February 2014, Wallen became a competitor on the popular televised singing competition The Voice,
                blind auditioning for the judges with the song "Collide" by Howie Day. Usher liked Wallen's performance,
                and Morgan joined his team. After the second Battle Round, Wallen was stolen by Adam Levine's team, but
                Morgan was eliminated in the playoffs. The Voice gave Wallen nationwide exposure, but it also helped
                him find a collaborator; Sergio Sánchez of the band Atom Smash was a vocal coach on the show, and the
                two began writing songs together that suited Wallen's country voice and rock & roll attitude. He moved
                to Nashville, where he and Sánchez formed a short-lived band, Morgan Wallen & Them Shadows.
